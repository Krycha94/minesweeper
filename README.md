# Minesweeper Game

[SEE THIS PROJECT LIVE](https://minesweeper-krycha.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview

Modern looking Minesweeper game, I created in React with basic CSS. The game has 3 levels of difficulty that you can choose from, a left click of the mouse reveals the square and a right click sets the flag (on mobile devices hold). Safe squares have numbers telling you how many mines touch the square. You can use the number clues to solve the game by opening all of the safe squares. If you click on a mine you lose the game.

## Technologies

In this project I used:

-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) Build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects (version: 4.1.0)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library for building user interfaces (version: 18.2.0)
